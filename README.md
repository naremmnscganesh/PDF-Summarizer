# PDF Summarizer üìù

A web-based application that allows users to upload a PDF file and receive a concise, AI-generated summary of its content. This tool leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to help you quickly understand the key points of lengthy documents, saving you time and effort.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Simple Web Interface**: Easy-to-use interface built with Streamlit.
* **Upload Any PDF**: Supports uploading of PDF documents directly from your computer.
* **AI-Powered Summarization**: Utilizes a pre-trained NLP model to generate high-quality summaries.
* **Fast and Efficient**: Quickly processes documents and delivers summaries in seconds.
* **Open Source**: Freely available for use and modification.

## üíª Technologies Used

* **Language**: Python
* **Framework**: Streamlit
* **Core Libraries**:
    * `PyPDF2`: For extracting text from PDF files.
    * `transformers`: For accessing and using state-of-the-art NLP models from Hugging Face.
    * `torch` / `tensorflow`: As a backend for the transformer models.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/naremmnscganesh/PDF-Summarizer.git](https://github.com/naremmnscganesh/PDF-Summarizer.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd PDF-Summarizer
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    *(It is highly recommended to create a virtual environment first)*
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you should create one by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt`)*


## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Application

1.  Open your terminal in the project's root directory.
2.  Run the following command to start the Streamlit server:
    ```sh
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    *(Assuming your main script is named `app.py`)*

3.  The application will open automatically in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## üìñ Usage

1.  Once the application is running, you will see a web page with a title and a file uploader.
2.  Click the "Browse files" button and select a PDF document from your computer.
3.  The application will automatically process the file and display the generated summary on the screen.
